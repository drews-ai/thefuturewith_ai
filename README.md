# The Future With AI
Ideas so good if someone took them from me I'd live in that world all the same.
> *a poem by Drew*

This repository contains the open-sourced visionary thesis and tooling proposals for a ground-up reorganization of society in response to mass AI-driven labor displacement.

## What This Is

This work includes:
- Systemic redesign frameworks (EndWork.ai, ShareWith.ai, CommunityGardens.ai, DoNotGlimpse.ai)
- UI/UX and conceptual interface design for post-capitalist coordination
- Thought experiments and ethnographic scaffolding for societal transition
- Language, theology, and psychological profiles supporting agentic liberation
- Instructional material for community activation and localized autonomy

This repo documents the first serious attempt to prototype a spiritual, technical, and economic transition plan to post-labor society. The ideas here are intended for open development, not profit. Contributors are encouraged to remix, react, and refine.
