This folder contains ideas and concepts related to DoNotGlimpse.ai - exploring privacy protection, information security, and AI systems designed to safeguard personal data and prevent unwanted surveillance.

## Overview

DoNotGlimpse.ai is a warning and a blueprint. It exposes the final frontier of deception‚Äîwhen artificial intelligence, immersive interface, and neural fidelity converge to fabricate a world so convincing, you forget there ever was a real one. This project asserts a new Turing threshold: not when machines talk like us, but when they convince us we never left reality at all. It is a phenomenological, theological, and ethical resistance to synthetic immersion‚Äîbuilt to preserve embodied presence, safeguard consciousness, and refuse the great forgetting.

> Be it resolved: We must prevent the creation of any AI/VR system capable of realistically simulating the experience of having exited it.

- **Desire for immersion is escalating**  
  People increasingly *want* to enter convincing alternate realities.

- **The brain seeks infinite stimulation**  
  Inside a virtual ‚Äúbrain-verse,‚Äù it chooses novelty over nothingness.

- **Reality and faith lose contrast**  
  Without sight as contrast to faith, trust in truth and faith dissolves. 

- **Perception itself becomes unstable**  
  This mirrors [Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (DP/DR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder), where individuals feel detached from self and reality.
