# DoNotGlimpse.ai

This folder contains ideas and concepts related to DoNotGlimpse.ai - exploring privacy protection, information security, and AI systems designed to safeguard personal data and prevent unwanted surveillance.

## Overview

DoNotGlimpse.ai is a warning and a blueprint. It exposes the final frontier of deception‚Äîwhen artificial intelligence, immersive interface, and neural fidelity converge to fabricate a world so convincing, you forget there ever was a real one. This project asserts a new Turing threshold: not when machines talk like us, but when they convince us we never left reality at all. It is a phenomenological, theological, and ethical resistance to synthetic immersion‚Äîbuilt to preserve embodied presence, safeguard consciousness, and refuse the great forgetting.

> Be it resolved: We must to prevent the creation of any AI or VR system capable of realistically simulating the experience of having exited it.

- **Modern obedience is utility-trained**  
  Society conditions people to follow systems, not to think critically.

- **VR and neural links risk disembodiment**  
  Immersive tech can sever the mind from the physical body.

- **A new Turing test emerges**  
  The *Do Not Glimpse Test* measures perceptual deception, not conversational trickery.

- **Desire for immersion is escalating**  
  People increasingly *want* to enter convincing alternate realities.

- **The brain seeks infinite stimulation**  
  Inside a virtual ‚Äúbrain-verse,‚Äù it chooses novelty over nothingness.

- **Reality and faith lose contrast**  
  Without friction or imperfection, trust in truth and spirit dissolves.

- **Perception itself becomes unstable**  
  This mirrors [Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (DP/DR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder), where individuals feel detached from self and reality.

- **Mass psychosis becomes a product feature**  
  What fractures cognition is marketed as entertainment or therapy.

- **Do not glimpse‚Äîresist the veil**  
  This is a moral, psychological, and theological stand.

- **Helping the poor is no excuse**  
  False compassion must not justify widespread deception.

- **Act now‚Äîshare and warn**  
  Spread this message through churches, social media, legislation, and family.
